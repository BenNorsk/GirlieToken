The Girlie (GRL) token is a Solana native ERC-20 token. It is used by the Cambridge Girlies.

## How may I store Girlies?
The Girlie token resides on the Solana blockchain. Therefore, you need a Solana wallet to store your Girlies.

It is recommended to download the Phantom wallet to store Girlies:
