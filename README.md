The Girlie (GRL) token is a Solana native ERC-20 token. It is used by the Cambridge Girlies.

## How may I store Girlies?
The Girlie token resides on the Solana blockchain. Therefore, you need a Solana wallet to store your Girlies.

It is recommended to download the Phantom wallet to store Girlies:

- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.phantom&hl=en_GB)
- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phantom-crypto-wallet/id1598432977)
- [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/phantom/bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa?hl=en)

The wallet stores your Girlies. Make sure you do not lose its password.

## How may I get Girlies?

To get Girlies, you may purchase them at 1£ / Girlie. Therefore, you may send Solana to this address:

`8fiePgrQRUfTSbLCyP4TBQuhJLe3FAPy1JEYrEc2L5rs`

Benjamin will send you your Girlies back in return. Alternatively, you may purchase Girlies using cash in-person.

## How many Girlies are there?
The supply of Girlies is limited to 1'000 Girlies. At any time, you may return your Girlies at a rate of 1£/Girlie.

## I wish to send Girlies to my friends. How can I do that?
You may send Girlies to your friends by sending Girlies to the following Girlie-addresses:

- **Ben:** `8fiePgrQRUfTSbLCyP4TBQuhJLe3FAPy1JEYrEc2L5rs`

To get Girlies, simply send your address to your friends. Like phone numbers, Girlie-addresses can be saved to a contact (so you only need to copy them once). 

## Are my Girlies secure?
Yes, your Girlies are secure. Girlies uses the standard ERC-20 protocol for fungible tokens. The token itself lives on the Solana blockchain, which is protected by over 1'000'000 weekly proof of stake (PoS) miners. Your Girlies are more secure than your cash in your wallet.

## Additional Information
Sending and receiving Girlies costs a tiny, tiny amount of Solana (SOL) - just a fraction of a penny. It is thus recommended to hold around 1£ worth of Solana in your wallet. You may top up your Phantom wallet using your credit card, or **ask Ben to send you some cents of his Solana**.
